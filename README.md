# GLDPNG

The GLDPNG library was written by Tarquin <tarquin@px-c.net> in the late 1990s to the early 2000s.
Although official support has ended with release 3.4.3F the code is still in use in some applications to this day, most notably GraphicsGale.

This repository is an attempt to reconstruct the development history of GLDPNG using archive gathered from everywhere on the Internet and to preserve its source code.

Neither bug fixes nor feature requests will be accepted.
