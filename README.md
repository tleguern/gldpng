# GLDPNG

The GLDPNG library was written by Tarquin <tarquin@px-c.net> in the late 1990s to the early 2000s.
Although official support has ended with release 3.4.3F the code is still in use in some applications to this day, most notably GraphicsGale.

This repository is an attempt to reconstruct the development history of GLDPNG using archive gathered from everywhere on the Internet and to preserve its source code.

Neither bug fixes nor feature requests will be accepted.

## Manuals

The original HTML manuals in Japanese are located in the `manual` folder.
They have been converted from Shift_JS to UTF8 so modern browsers and text editors have an easier time displaying them.

Botched English translations exists for the GLDPNG3.html and GLDPNG3_FAQ.html files.
They are not cannon and should not be relied upon too much.

Finally a markdown version of GLDPNG3.html exists for the convenience of Github users.
